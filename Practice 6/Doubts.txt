Using RGB or Grayscale images?

In remove_segmentation_noise should i use r as radius?

In seg_by_diff, can I use abs instead of absdiff? If I use absdiff, where i have to threshold??

In apply_mask, 1 channel or 3?

In fsiv_seg_by_model and fsiv_seg_by_seg i have to use the noise removal? 
I guess i have to, cuz u gave us the R as a parameter...

In acc_model which option is better?

In upadte_model which option is better?
